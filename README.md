## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Database Configuration with phpMyAdmin

The shopRADO platform uses a MySQL database that can be easily set up through phpMyAdmin, which comes integrated with XAMPP.

### Step 1: Creating the Database.

**Database Name:** `shoprado`

### Database Schema

The application uses three main tables to handle user management, product catalog, and shopping cart functionality:

**Database Tables Overview:**
- **users** - Stores customer and admin account information
- **products** - Contains product catalog with details and pricing
- **cart** - Manages shopping cart items for each user

### Table Structure & SQL Scripts

#### Users Table
Stores user account information with role-based access control.

**Structure:**
- `id` - Primary key, auto-increment
- `username` - User display name (50 characters max)
- `email` - Unique email address (100 characters max)
- `password` - Encrypted password (255 characters for hash)
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp
- `role` - User role (user/admin) with default as 'user'

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user'
);
```

#### Products Table
Contains product catalog information with pricing and media.

**Structure:**
- `id` - Primary key, auto-increment
- `name` - Product name (255 characters max)
- `price` - Product price (decimal with 2 decimal places)
- `description` - Product description (text field)
- `image` - Product image filename (255 characters max)
- `created_at` - Product creation timestamp

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    image VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Cart Table
Manages shopping cart functionality with user-product relationships.

**Structure:**
- `id` - Primary key, auto-increment
- `user_id` - Foreign key linking to users table
- `product_id` - Foreign key linking to products table
- `quantity` - Number of items in cart
- `created_at` - Item addition timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last modification timestamp

```sql
CREATE TABLE cart (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Database Setup Instructions

1. **Open phpMyAdmin** through XAMPP Control Panel
2. **Create Database:**
   - Click "New" in the left sidebar
   - Enter database name: `shoprado`
   - Click "Create"
3. **Create Tables:**
   - Select the `shoprado` database
   - Go to "SQL" tab
   - Copy and paste each table creation script above
   - Execute each script to create the tables
4. **Verify Setup:**
   - Check that all three tables are created successfully
   - Verify table structures match the specifications above



### Step 2: Setting Up `db.php`

1. **Create Project Structure:**
   - Create a folder named `includes` in your project root directory
   - This folder will contain all configuration and utility files

2. **Database Configuration File:**
   - Inside the `includes` folder, create a file named `db.php`
   - This file handles the MySQL database connection

**File Path:** `includes/db.php`

```php
<?php
$host = 'localhost';
$dbname = 'shoprado';
$user = 'root';
$password = '';

try {
    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname", $user, $password);
    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

**Configuration Details:**
- **Host:** `localhost` (XAMPP default)
- **Database Name:** `shoprado` (as created in phpMyAdmin)
- **Username:** `root` (XAMPP default MySQL user)
- **Password:** Empty string (XAMPP default - no password)

**PDO Benefits:**
- **Security:** Prepared statements prevent SQL injection
- **Portability:** Works with multiple database systems
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive exception handling
- **Performance:** Efficient database operations

### Step 3: Testing Database Connection

Create a test file to verify your database connection is working properly.

**File Path:** `test_db.php` (in project root)

```php
<?php
include 'includes/db.php';

if ($conn) {
    echo "Database connected successfully!";
} else {
    echo "Failed to connect to the database.";
}
?>
```

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Save the test file in your project root directory
2. Ensure XAMPP Apache and MySQL services are running
3. Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost/shopRADO/test_db.php`
4. Verify the message **"Database connected successfully!"** appears
5. If successful, you can delete the test file (optional)

**Troubleshooting Connection Issues:**
- Ensure MySQL service is running in XAMPP Control Panel
- Verify database name matches exactly: `shoprado`
- Check that all tables are created in phpMyAdmin
- Confirm the `includes` folder path is correct
